## Inspiration
A potential challenge during the pandemic outbreak like COVID19 is overwhelming hospitals. Due to the increase in the number of COVID patients, doctors are giving less attention to a non-COVID patient. Right now, hospitals don't have the capacity for the large number of incoming patients. Not just during COVID but also during normal time we need some platform that guides us through our health problems. It should help each and every person either educated or uneducated to diagnose their disease and get out of danger. Our project addresses all these issues. 

## What it does
Aivo platform offers an ideal way to let people know what medicine to take for symptoms they tell and also know more about the disease they have by describing the symptoms. This tool can be deployed in large scale as it is useful for everyone right from mobiles to Kiosk alike model in every Pharmacy stores. 

## How we built it
We used the IBM Watson along with Alan studio for this project.
* IBM Watson
  * User Interaction
  * Realtime Database
    * Store Vital Data and User Information
  * Cloud Functions
* Other IBM
  * IBM API for websites
Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS
* Bootstrap Framework
  * Use of JQuery
  * Use of SmartForm for Contact
  * Frontend Framework

GitHub
  * File Management
  * Hosting
Alan Studio
  * Voice based interaction 
  * Smart communication with website and AI functionalities.

 Aivo - Alan is a Smart Assistant that we have built for users to ask simple questions. *You can ask it I have a Cough* and it will respond

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into, but that's what programming's all about. One of the difficult challenges we ran into was making sure the UI worked. Another challenge was figuring out how to to extract information from the JSON file to the website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of so many things. We made use of this project to the best of our abilities. We got to use the IBM Watson, which is a first for all of us, we had used IBM Watson before and we will continue to use this platform. Additionally, we combined all of our skills to create a website that use multiple frameworks and we are proud of this website. We love the UI/UX and we love the Backend, it was our first time as well using these frameworks. Finally, we are proud of the amount of work we pulled of. We would have never thought we could accomplish this much in such a small amount of time.

## What we learned
* Creating realtime databases
* Alan Studio
* User Authentication
* IBM Watson
## What's next for DrFit
* Implement IBM Watson instead of Alan (Wider range of possibilites)
* Implement more Google Cloud Features including Tensorflow AI for medical classification and image classificatin to find various conditions
* Implement a TeleHealth API platform for virtual doctor visits
* Implement a precise Covid-19 screener questionaire for the workplace and schools
